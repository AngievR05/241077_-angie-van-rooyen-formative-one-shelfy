# Google Books API Data Visualization

## Overview
This project is a web application that fetches data from the Google Books API and visualizes it using Chart.js. The frontend is built with React, and the backend handles API requests with Node.js. The application aims to present book-related data interactively and intuitively.

## Features
- Fetch book data from the Google Books API.
- Visualise data using Chart.js.
- Responsive and interactive UI built with React.
- Organized component-based architecture.

## Setup Instructions

## Approach
1. Data Fetching: The app retrieves book-related data from the Google Books API asynchronously.
2. State Management: React's state and hooks manage data flow within components.
